# PA-Final-
This is the final project for CS12b with Hickey 
Based on the extension of PA05 a blood alcohol calculator that has a slider widget and a music widget 
The arraylist has been taken out of the code 
It appears small on my computer but may be different for others. Try it out. 
Any organizational changes to the columns are encouraged 
The music so far just plays there is no stop or pause which could be something to input
And the music only stops when you exit out completely
